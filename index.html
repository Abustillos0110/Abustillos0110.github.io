    <h3>About Me...</h3>
    <p>I am 19 years old and a Sagittarius. My favorite colors are grey, pink, and black. My favorite number is 47, do not know why. I love fruits and dislikes vegetables. I am the oldest daughter of three and second oldest of four. I grew up in Madera and Fresno. I enjoy budgeting and organizing. I love numbers!! I am obsessed with Pinterest and shopping at Wal-Mart. Sidenote, I dislike my name very much. I feel that the name Alyssa is so basic. </p>

          <h4>My family</h4>
          <h5>What I call family.</h5>
          <p>I have a four year old son named Goliath. I love love love that his name is unique and different. He is such a pain, but I would not have it any other way. Also, I have a fiance that is so hilarious. Now, with him I won the lottery. Truthfully, he is what keeps me sane when it comes to "my mother".</p>

          <h4>My major</h4>
          <h5>Accounting</h5>
          <p>Right now, I am taking it one step at a time and aiming for my associate's degree. Then if I feel that I am ready, I will start my next chapter in school, the bachelor's degree. So far, I enjoy accounting and do awesome on homeworks. However, I am not doing so good on the exams.... The exams have words! </p>

          <h4>My giving back</h4>
          <h5>Volunteer and donate</h5>
          <p>Usually, I volunteer with the Just Between Friends consignment center and the community food bank. I donate blood every chance I get whether when the trucks are around or going down to the center. Also, I donate clothes and toys to friends in need. I dislike selling my son's used items. I want other kids parents to have one thing less to worry about.</p>

          <h4>My struggles</h4>
          <h5>My mother</h5>
          <p>I do not mean to put my mother down. I do love her, but honestly she is my biggest struggle of all and a constant one. She is a bad influence and holds me back to the fullest. I get her intentions are good, but her ways of doing things are not always legal and right.</p>

          <h4>My goals</h4>

      <h2>Plants vs Zombies</h2>
      <p>My son and I are very devoted to this game. Lately, I have been debating whether to buy the plushes off of ebay. However, I do not want to be disappointed if the plush are too small. This is the farthest I have ever gotten thanks to my son. I know he probably should not be playing this game, but I prefer plants vs zombies compared to fighting and shooting games. I love using strategies! It is the only game I play daily.</p>

      <h2>Dreamcatchers</h2>
      <p>I admire dreamcatchers so much!! They are absolute gorgeoues and each one is unique. I want hundreds of them in my apartment. I believe they will catch all the dreams I cannot remember. I enjoy the different colors, shapes, and sizes. I did extensive amount of research and they are pretty pricey and takes a lot of patience. Best place to purchase them is off of Esty. </p>
